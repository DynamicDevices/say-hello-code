## üìö Language Description Improvements

### Before vs After Examples

**Python (Before):**
> "Python is a programming language created in 1991 by Guido van Rossum. It was designed for popular and is known for its Multi-paradigm paradigm(s)..."

**Python (After):**
> "A high-level programming language emphasizing code readability and simplicity. Python's extensive libraries and readable syntax have made it popular for web development, data science, artificial intelligence, and automation."

**Rust (Before):**
> "Rust is a programming language created in 2010 by Mozilla. It was designed for systems and is known for its Multi-paradigm paradigm(s)..."

**Rust (After):**
> "A systems programming language that runs blazingly fast, prevents segfaults, and guarantees thread safety. Rust achieves memory safety without garbage collection, making it ideal for system programming, web backends, and performance-critical applications."
